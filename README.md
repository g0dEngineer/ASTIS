# Advanced Solutions Technical Institute - Smart Ai Curriculum (ASTIS) Via https://www.astitnt.com


# Diploma or Certificate: "Universal Artificial Intelligence Diploma (UAD, ASTIS)"
[Practical Ai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#Applications) Diploma with core focus on neural networks as [universal problem solvers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem).

# Nothing sweeter than artificial neural networks!
It is quite empowering to store these ~1000 lines of fundamental neural network code in one's memory (an approximation of our own biological brains), and it will be almost addictive to repeat daily, but distancing the instances one practices this cycle (for every 6 to 8 months) reasonably helps to cement understanding of what is being memorized.

As underlined in prior [Live Neural network sessions by Lead UAD Lecturer Bennett](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/Live-Agile-Artificial-Neural-Network-Programming-Sessions), artificial neural networks can represent a wide variety of utilities/functions as seen in [Universal Approximation Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem), and since neural networks power most cognitive/smart apps today, ranging from Tesla's self-driving cars, to Facebook's auto face tagging Ai, ASTIS targets this core field. Learning neural networks which are general models, gives rise to intuition needed to venture elsewhere if necessary.

# Beyond practical Machine Learning Library application, this Diploma entails as prescribed by UAD Lecturer God Bennett, a cyclical fundamental artificial neural network writing session, occurring at the end of each week, designed to hammer this concept/tool in the mind of the candidate.

# Introduction
There are thousands of Ai links online, and this course condenses both ASTI lecturer's work as well as powerful models by large corporations like tensorflow [into consumable pathways](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/ASTIS#rapidoptimal-6-week-curriculum). 

* Related to the core components; with ASTI's emphasis and main focus on Neural Networks, ([universal problem solvers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem))... it is ASTI lecturer's duty to always provide direct feedback and guidance throughout the lecturer's own academic software work/teachings, as well the models of the large corporations like tensorflow. 

* Separate/outside of the Syllabus-Exam rubric & Diploma, UAD lecturer Bennett introduces Human Level Ai/Artificial General Intelligence.
* Related to the aforesaid bonus component, **unlike typical Ai/Ml programs**, it is thus ASTI lecturer's duty to [softly introduce candidates into the world of Artificial General Intelligence](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/ASTIS/blob/main/data/Introduction%20to%20Artificial%20General%20Intelligence.pdf) (AGI...which is currently separate from the world of tensorflow/specialized Ai etc, and often referred to as man's last invention by Dr Ben Goertzel, and several other AGI pioneers).

**Course Pathways**: https://github.com/g0dEngineer/ASTIS#rapidoptimal-6-week-curriculum

# ASTI's Multi-Pathway/Dynamic lines of pedagogy (Divide and Conquer)

***Figure ([made by Bennett in Context Free Art](https://www.contextfreeart.org/gallery/view.php?id=3603)): Single, apparently cluttered learning pathway normally found in typical ai software programs.***

Most known software ai programs tend to aim to encapsulate too many types of learning students into single pathways, and as a result, said programs reasonably tend to be 3+ months long.

***Figure ([made by Bennett in Context Free Art](https://www.contextfreeart.org/gallery/view.php?id=3603)): Multi-pathway learning lines, tailored to candidates of different starting points of knowledge.***

ASTI does multiple paths ([in the divide and conquer regime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm)), instead of trying to fit many things along a single path. We therein reduce time to approximately 6 weeks. Time is also reduced due to our focus on broad neural networks as [universal problem solvers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem).


# Meaning of life & the ASTIS roadmap: 
 * Start as a typical computer user with or without programming skills, and end as an Artificial Intelligence product creator and profit from [Ai's predicted 15 Trillion dollar 2030 market cap](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2019/02/25/ai-will-add-15-trillion-to-the-world-economy-by-2030/?sh=76b9bd4e1852), or a more recent prediction of [80 trillion by 2030 according to ark invest  (likely as the most important sector)!](https://youtu.be/UBmcCRno35A)
 * With [800 million jobs to be automated away by 2030](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42170100), and Artificial Intelligence market cap at [15 trillion around the same time](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2019/02/25/ai-will-add-15-trillion-to-the-world-economy-by-2030/?sh=76b9bd4e1852), or a more recent prediction of [80 trillion by 2030 according to ark invest  (likely as the most important sector)!](https://youtu.be/UBmcCRno35A), become a builder of Ai solutions, and [capture your chunk of the exponentially growing Ai market](https://singularityhub.com/2018/07/15/why-most-of-us-fail-to-grasp-coming-exponential-gains-in-ai/).

# First known practical Neural Network Programming Course with an Introduction to Artificial General Intelligence :)
# This originally stemmed from an initiative to develop worldâ€™s 1st university, just for Artificial Intelligence. (See local newspaper articles by ASTI Ai Course Author, [in 2018](https://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20180604/artificial-intelligence-and-economy-utilising-artificial-intelligence-could) and [2019](https://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20191229/why-jamaica-urgently-needs-minister-artificial-intelligence))

# Why learn Ai development and application?
1. [The world's smartest people are switching careers into Ai research and application/productization!](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/god-bennett_httpslnkdinebrmfzu-activity-6761811288260694016-70Ys).
2. According to [PwC Global](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/data-and-analytics/publications/artificial-intelligence-study.html), Ai will yield a [15 trillion dollar market cap by the year 2030](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2019/02/25/ai-will-add-15-trillion-to-the-world-economy-by-2030/?sh=76b9bd4e1852), or a more recent prediction of [80 trillion by 2030 according to ark invest (likely as the most important sector)!](https://youtu.be/UBmcCRno35A). This is around the same time [800 million jobs shall be automated away, according to Bank of America](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42170100).
 * It is thus key to intimately benefit in this automation effort, rather than fail to do so.



# Introduction
1. Brain inspired computer code or smart apps, called **AGI or artificial _general_ intelligence** (predicted to happen by [as soon as 2029 or sooner](http://www.businessinsider.com/ray-kurzweil-thinks-well-have-human-level-ai-by-2029-2014-12)), will perhaps one day be [mankind's last invention!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9snY7lhJA4c) For now though, AGI's predecessor, called **artificial _narrow_ intelligence**, also called **artificial intelligence**, can do amazing stuff like [diagnose diseases better than human doctors](https://futurism.com/ai-diagnose-heart-disease-lung-cancer-more-accurately-doctors/), or [give game characters the ability to learn to navigate game environments without human aid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44)! 

* [Google, Microsoft etc, are working towards AGI today](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-019-00887-x).

2. Crucially, for eg, bodies in non-ai strong countries, like the **Jamaican government** [has recognized that artificial narrow intelligence, a part of machine learning, is a threat to jobs](http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20180418/beware-artificial-intelligence-wheatley-warns-bpo-sector). Notably, [here's a list of jobs where robots or smart software are already replacing humans](https://blog.cheapism.com/robots-taking-jobs/). 
* [See these recent Ai/GPT-3 based examples, that are already doing things like introductory level automated software engineering, including website/react js/html creation, game creation, machine learning code, all automatically generated using simple english prompts!!!](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/god-bennett_creating-a-space-game-with-openai-codex-activity-6832023549859958784-mq9f)
* [See Ai/Gpt-3 longer format auto code demo](https://youtu.be/SGUCcjHTmGY).

3. As the **1st machine learning school established in the Carribean** in May, 2021, [ASTIS](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/ASTIS) seeks to help more and more Jamaicans to find out what steps they can take to acquire skills needed to **stay relevant** in a world that's more and more driven by artificial intelligence, that shall replace more and more jobs with physical robots and or smart software. 

4. As such, [ASTIS](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/ASTIS) is an institute that aims to bring more Jamaicans into the modern world of artificial intelligence and programming through fun, tailored lectures. Pertinently, see the "why" tab on the [ASTIS website](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/ASTIS), to find out why **high-schoolers, or even busy Masters/PhD/Professor people who are not trained in the machine learning field can participate in modern machine learning**!


# Rapid/Optimal ~6+ Week Curriculum
This curriculum is designed to cater to two main categories of users, including **non-programmers** and **programmers**. Those two categories naturally cover persons including those with **High school diplomas, Bachelors degrees, Masters degrees, PhDs, and Professorships**.

The two main categories above are expressible as 2 types, based on the goals that [ASTIS](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/ASTIS) desginates its students to perform.

As such, from here on out, you select one of the types below, and begin your learning process:

1. [ASTIS For Non programmers (Type A)](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/ASTIS/tree/main/data/TypeA_NonProgrammers)
2. [ASTIS For Programmers (Type B)](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/ASTIS/tree/main/data/MainProgrammerPage)

![Alt Text](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/ASTIS/blob/main/data/tick.png)

By the time you complete either one of [ASTIS](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/ASTIS)'s curriculum types above, you would be a marketable candidate, qualified to attain remote work with the capability to earn [beyond 80,000 USD per year](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/s/Remote-Data-Scientist-Salary), whether you're a high schooler or professor who was not priorly trained in [Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning). Also, you would be in far better position for local work, and better able to prepare for automation of more and more jobs in the globe, and in the country.


# Curriculum Requirements
1. Candidates must have at least passed the [GSAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_Six_Achievement_Test) or completed the [PEP](http://www.moe.gov.jm/primary-exit-profile-pep) or something similar. (From Primary to Tertiary Education and beyond, i.e. Additionally, up to PhD/Professor level candidates are welcome too!) 
* The requirement above essentially concerns just before high school level all the way up to PhD/Professor people who want to profit from Ai development!
2. Candidates must be willing to devote at most 6 to 8+ weeks to ASTIS's curriculum. In other words, candidates must be willing to build himself/herself, by acquiring machine learning skills through ASTIS's 6-8+ week curriculum.
3. Candidates need to have access to [machine learning computers](https://pub.towardsai.net/best-laptops-for-machine-learning-deep-learning-data-science-ml-f55602197593), or online machine learning compute like [free colab instances](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb).
4. This course also advises for the use of datasets such as those [from kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). Ai/Machine learning is normally complete with ingredients:
* Ai Knowledge/Skills (which this course builds in each candidate)
* Ai Compute
* Ai Compatible/Consumable Datasets




# Why Artificial Neural Network focussed?

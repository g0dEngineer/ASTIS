# Advanced Solutions Technical Institute - Smart Ai Curriculum (ASTIS) Via https://www.astitnt.com

# Course: "A Practical/Rapid ~6+ Week Ai Course is all you need" 

# Meaning of life & the ASTIS roadmap: 
 * Start as a typical computer user with or without programming skills, and end as an Artificial Intelligence product creator and profit from [Ai's predicted 15 Trillion dollar 2030 market cap](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2019/02/25/ai-will-add-15-trillion-to-the-world-economy-by-2030/?sh=76b9bd4e1852)! 
 * With [800 million jobs to be automated away by 2030](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42170100), and Artificial Intelligence market cap at [15 trillion around the same time](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2019/02/25/ai-will-add-15-trillion-to-the-world-economy-by-2030/?sh=76b9bd4e1852), become a builder of Ai solutions, and [capture your chunk of the exponentially growing Ai market](https://singularityhub.com/2018/07/15/why-most-of-us-fail-to-grasp-coming-exponential-gains-in-ai/).
     * As an ASTIS trained person [who happens to be a farmer], building out an Ai farming application to classify your farm yield, is one of thousands of exciting practical/profitable AI apps, through ASTIS roadmap.

# Why learn Ai development and application?
1. [The world's smartest people are switching careers into Ai research and application/productization!](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/god-bennett_httpslnkdinebrmfzu-activity-6761811288260694016-70Ys).
2. According to [PwC Global](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/data-and-analytics/publications/artificial-intelligence-study.html), Ai will yield a [15 trillion dollar market cap by the year 2030](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2019/02/25/ai-will-add-15-trillion-to-the-world-economy-by-2030/?sh=76b9bd4e1852). This is around the same time [800 million jobs shall be automated away, according to Bank of America](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42170100).
 * It is thus key to intimately benefit in this automation effort, rather than fail to do so.

# Introduction
1. Brain inspired computer code or smart apps, called **AGI or artificial _general_ intelligence** (predicted to happen by [as soon as 2029 or sooner](http://www.businessinsider.com/ray-kurzweil-thinks-well-have-human-level-ai-by-2029-2014-12)), will perhaps one day be [mankind's last invention!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9snY7lhJA4c) For now though, AGI's predecessor, called **artificial _narrow_ intelligence**, also called **artificial intelligence**, can do amazing stuff like [diagnose diseases better than human doctors](https://futurism.com/ai-diagnose-heart-disease-lung-cancer-more-accurately-doctors/), or [give game characters the ability to learn to navigate game environments without human aid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44)! 

* [Google, Microsoft etc, are working towards AGI today](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-019-00887-x).

2. Crucially, for eg, bodies in non-ai strong countries, like the **Jamaican government** [has recognized that artificial narrow intelligence, a part of machine learning, is a threat to jobs](http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20180418/beware-artificial-intelligence-wheatley-warns-bpo-sector). Notably, [here's a list of jobs where robots or smart software are already replacing humans](https://blog.cheapism.com/robots-taking-jobs/). 

3. As the **1st machine learning school established in the Carribean** in May, 2021, [ASTIS](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/ASTIS) seeks to help more and more Jamaicans to find out what steps they can take to acquire skills needed to **stay relevant** in a world that's more and more driven by artificial intelligence, that shall replace more and more jobs with physical robots and or smart software. 

4. As such, [ASTIS](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/ASTIS) is an institute that aims to bring more Jamaicans into the modern world of artificial intelligence and programming through fun, tailored lectures. Pertinently, see the "why" tab on the [ASTIS website](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/ASTIS), to find out why **high-schoolers, or even busy Masters/PhD/Professor people who are not trained in the machine learning field can participate in modern machine learning**!


# Rapid/Optimal ~6+ Week Curriculum
This curriculum is designed to cater to two main categories of users, including **non-programmers** and **programmers**. Those two categories naturally cover persons including those with **High school diplomas, Bachelors degrees, Masters degrees, PhDs, and Professorships**.

The two main categories above are expressible as 2 types, based on the goals that [ASTIS](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/ASTIS) desginates its students to perform.

As such, from here on out, you select one of the types below, and begin your learning process:

1. [ASTIS For Non programmers (Type A)](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/ASTIS/tree/main/data/TypeA_NonProgrammers)
2. [ASTIS For Programmers (Type B)](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/ASTIS/tree/main/data/MainProgrammerPage)

![Alt Text](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/ASTIS/blob/main/data/tick.png)

By the time you complete either one of [ASTIS](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/ASTIS)'s curriculum types above, you would be a marketable candidate, qualified to attain remote work with the capability to earn [beyond 80,000 USD per year](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/s/Remote-Data-Scientist-Salary), whether you're a high schooler or professor who was not priorly trained in [Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning). Also, you would be in far better position for local work, and better able to prepare for automation of more and more jobs in the globe, and in the country.


# Curriculum Requirements
1. Candidates must have at least passed the [GSAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_Six_Achievement_Test) or completed the [PEP](http://www.moe.gov.jm/primary-exit-profile-pep) or something similar. (Additionally, up to PhD/Professor level candidates are welcome too!) 
* The requirement above essentially concerns just before high school level all the way up to PhD/Professor people who want to profit from Ai development!
2. Candidates must be willing to devote 6 to 8+ weeks to ASTIS's curriculum. In other words, candidates must be willing to build himself/herself, by acquiring machine learning skills through ASTIS's 6-8+ week curriculum.



# Why Artificial Neural Network focussed?
![Alt Text](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/ASTIS/blob/main/data/logo.png)

As underlined in [prior Live Neural network sessions by organizer Bennett](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/Live-Agile-Artificial-Neural-Network-Programming-Sessions), artificial neural networks can represent a wide variety of utilities/functions as seen in [Universal Approximation Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem), and since neural networks power most cognitive/smart apps today, ranging from Tesla's self driving cars, to Facebook's auto face tagging Ai, CAII targets this core field. Learning neural networks which are general models, gives rise to intuition needed to venture elsewhere if neccessary.

# Recommended reading for babies
ASTIS's course is designed for teens/adults. Albeit, take a look at these intriguing books for babies: [Einsteinian books for babies](https://medium.com/@jordanmicahbennett/einsteinian-books-for-babies-4aa18c3c23c)

# Recommended long term reading for students

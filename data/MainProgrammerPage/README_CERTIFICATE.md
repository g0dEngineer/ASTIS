1. [ASTIS For Programmers that know python, and know github (Tier A)](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/ASTIS/tree/main/data/MainProgrammerPage/data/TypeB_Programmers_TierA)
2. [ASTIS For Programmers that know python, but don't know github (Tier B)](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/ASTIS/tree/main/data/MainProgrammerPage/data/TypeB_Programmers_TierB)
3. [ASTIS For Programmers that don't know python, but know github (Tier C)](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/ASTIS/tree/main/data/MainProgrammerPage/data/TypeB_Programmers_TierC)
4. [ASTIS For Programmers that don't know python, and don't know github (Tier D)](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/ASTIS/tree/main/data/MainProgrammerPage/data/TypeB_Programmers_TierD)

Each of the above may vary based on the candidate's awareness of python and github, which are designated by [ASTIS](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/ASTIS) as crucial components in the resulting career seeking endeavour at the curriculum's completion.

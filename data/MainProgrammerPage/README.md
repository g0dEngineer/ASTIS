There are thousands of Ai links online, and this course condenses both ASTI lecturer's work as well as powerful models by large corporations like tensorflow [into consumable pathways](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/ASTIS#rapidoptimal-6-week-curriculum). 

 * Related to the core components; with ASTI's emphasis and main focus on Neural Networks, ([universal problem solvers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem))... it is ASTI lecturer's duty to always provide direct feedback and guidance throughout the lecturer's own academic software work/teachings, as well the models of the large corporations like tensorflow. 

* Separate/outside of the Syllabus-Exam rubric & Diploma, UAD lecturer Bennett introduces Human Level Ai/Artificial General Intelligence, with a youtube video of an AGI related discussion with Bennett and AGI pioneer Dr. Eray Ozkural, 2015 Kurzweil AGI winner, and collaborator with people who coined the term artificial intelligence!
* Related to the aforesaid bonus component, **unlike typical Ai/Ml programs**, it is thus ASTI lecturer's duty to [softly introduce candidates into the world of Artificial General Intelligence](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/ASTIS/blob/main/data/Introduction%20to%20Artificial%20General%20Intelligence.pdf) (AGI...which is currently separate from the world of tensorflow/specialized Ai etc, and often refered to as man's last invention by Dr Eray Ozkural, Dr Ben Gortzel, and several other AGI pioneers).

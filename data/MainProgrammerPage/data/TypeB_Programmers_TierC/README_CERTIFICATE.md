# [ASTIS](http://mlj-institute.appspot.com/) Curriculum Type B, Tier C (For programmers that don't know python, but know github)
## Course Code: "ASTIS-CTBTCC" (CTBTC"C"â†’Certificate Award)

# Main Overview
This curriculum consists of 3 concise mandatory semesters/parts and one optimal segment; an  Introduction to Artificial General Intelligence.
1. The first semester, concerning **a quick review of python structure, since you're already a programmer** and a tutorial on **regularly used machine learning libraries in python**.
3. The second semester, concerning the main topic, **[Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning)**!
4. The last and third semester, concerning applying knowledge from the prior semesters, and attempting to **solve a problem faced by preferably your country or elsewhere**. (The code/idea developed is yours, and is not the property of [ASTIS](http://mlj-institute.appspot.com/).)

# Second Semester (Estimated Completion Duration: 6 weeks and 4 hours) ~ Study and Write "[Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning)" Code:


## Week 1 - Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks

1. Follow closely, [this 9 step neural network construction tutorial by Eden Au](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-in-python-numpy-neural-network-in-9-steps-eafd0db25906).
2. **Intuitive understanding** of basic machine learning components, such as fundamental artificial neural network structures, is important for **maintaining the desire** to continue to pursue the field of artificial intelligence/machine learning/data science. If you still desire a more intuitive description of the basic artificial neural networks described in item 1 above, read the text descriptions and watch the video content found in my book "**Artificial Neural Networks for Kids**". (Get the book from [this Amazon url](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077FX57ZZ), or get it free from [this Research-Gate url](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321162382_Artificial_Neural_Nets_For_Kids)).
3. (Optional) On your own, try to construct a basic artificial neural network from scratch, without the usage of any machine learning library. (You can follow this guidline of mine [here](https://its2019.iis-international.org/wp-content/uploads/ITS-2019-Tutorial.pdf) or [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PqCvorCsCiPqVkYZPjDpiIk41NOfGz-c/view?usp=sharing), taken from my presentation/programming tutorial at [ITS 2019](https://its2019.iis-international.org/program/selected-workshops-and-tutorials/).)
4. (Optional) Upload this code to your github account. Name it "My-Code_For-AICES-Week-1", or something similar.
5. Instead of on your own in item (3), let me guide you through, let's do [my live artificial neural network programming session](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/Live-Agile-Artificial-Neural-Network-Programming-Sessions)! Grab a [copy of bluej](https://www.bluej.org/download/release-notes.html) or use python to follow along to replicate my basic neural network code as I write it out! 

![Alt Text](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/ASTIS/blob/main/data/exclamation_mark.png)

* Even after you have done this entire course, practice this basic neural network programming session every 6 to 8 months on your own [(as I do here)](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/NEURAL_NETWORK_PRACTICE). More practice will grant you more intuition and grasp of Neural Networks/Machine Learning overall.
* As [dicussed prior](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/ASTIS#astis-multi-pathwaydynamic-lines-of-pedagogy-divide-and-conquer), neural networks are [universal problem solvers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem), and therein, learning to construct them is an optimal way to equip one's mind with core ML incredients.

# Spaced learning/ [See evidence of spaced learning on nature journal](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn.2015.18)

# It is quite empowering to store these ~1000 lines of fundamental neural network code in one's memory, and it will be almost addictive to repeat daily, but distancing the instances one practices this cycle (for every 6 to 8 months) reasonably helps to cement understanding of what is being memorized.


## Week 2 - Machine Learning Library Practice
1. Try to grind through [this 3 hour course on Tensorflow (Sections: "Beginner quickstart, Keras basics,Keras.Load data") ](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials). Tensorflow is a popular machine learning library. You can start with this, or resort to other libraries like MXNET. 

* You can use any one of these libraries for the subsequent weeks. Note that Tensorflow has the support of Google, so it may be wise to choose this library. MXNET also has the support of Microsoft, so that is not a bad option either.


## Week 3 - Convolutional Artificial Neural Networks

1. Watch [Convolution Neural Networks - explained!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8pOnJxOcqY) by Code Emporium.
2. Implement a Convolutional Neural Network (using any ML library like Tensorflow; [See example](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/faster_rcnn/inception_resnet_v2_640x640/1)), based on video above, or otherwise, to solve some problem. Include a document including your name, and 1 page describing the problem you solved.
3. Upload this code to your github account. Name it "My-Code_For-ASTIS-Week-3", or something similar.

## Week 4 - Recurrent Artificial Neural Networks or Transformers

1. Watch [Recurrent Neural Networks - explained!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZv_yRgOvMg) by Code Emporium.
2. Implement a Transformer, or Recurrent Neural Neural Network (using any ML library like Tensorflow; [See example](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/bert_en_uncased_L-12_H-768_A-12/3)), based on video above, or otherwise, to solve some problem. Include a document including your name, and 1 page describing the problem you solved.
3. Upload this code to your github account. Name it "My-Code_For-ASTIS-Week-4", or something similar.

# Week 4 End

Note: Please try to complete the 1st 5 chapters of [the Deep Learning Book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org) by Yoshua Bengio et al. (Bengio is one of the winners of the winners of the 2018 Turing Award, a Nobel-Prize like award for Artificial Intelligence. See the CBS News Report on [the aforesaid 2018 Turing Award](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWIV5xQoYbA)).


This semester concludes with a core review of mathematical notations ranging from Linear Algebra, to Numerical Computation. No code shall be uploaded for this last review.

# Third Semester Examination (Estimated Completion Duration: 4 days) ~ Setup and run a previously solved deep learning solution, then write a deep learning research paper

1. Based on [this github repo](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/SMART-CT-SCAN_BASED-COVID19_VIRUS_DETECTOR), look at [sample covid19 solution by ASTIS author, concerning Covid19 Diagnosis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341176434_World's_first_known_Open-Source_Machine_Learning_Convolutional_Artificial_Neural_Network_in_Covid19_XRay_Diagnosis_February_9_2020).
2. Discuss at least 5 sections/titles included in pdf paper.
3. Writing a research paper helps not only to communicate an ai project's ideas/results to other scientists, but helps the candidate to extract meaningful core information from a project.
4. Upload this paper to your github account. Name it "Paper_For-ASTIS-FinalSemester", or something similar.

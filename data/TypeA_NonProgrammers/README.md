There are thousands of Ai links online, and this course condenses both ASTI lecturer's work as well as powerful models by large corporations like tensorflow [into consumable pathways](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/ASTIS#rapidoptimal-6-week-curriculum). 

 * Related to the core components; with ASTI's emphasis and main focus on Neural Networks, ([universal problem solvers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem))... it is ASTI lecturer's duty to always provide direct feedback and guidance throughout the lecturer's own academic software work/teachings, as well the models of the large corporations like tensorflow. 

 * Related to the bonus component, **unlike typical Ai/Ml programs**, it is also ASTI lecturer's duty to [softly introduce candidates into the world of Artificial General Intelligence](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/ASTIS/blob/main/data/Introduction%20to%20Artificial%20General%20Intelligence.pdf) (AGI...which is currently separate from the world of tensorflow/specialized Ai etc), through AGI directions sought by the ASTI lecturer's additional academic work beyond specialized Ai work like tensorflow.
 * Additionally, the ASTI lecturer reveals a talk with an established AGI researcher, namely Dr. Eray Ozkural, [who worked with people who coined the term Ai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_workshop), and also received [Google Ray Kurzweil's 2015 AGI award](http://agi-conf.org/2015/prizes/)!

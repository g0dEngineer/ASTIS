# Nothing sweeter than artificial neural networks!

There are thousands of Ai links online, and this course condenses both ASTI lecturer's work as well as powerful models by large corporations like tensorflow [into consumable pathways](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/ASTIS#rapidoptimal-6-week-curriculum). One may aim to tap into [Ai's predicted 15 Trillion dollar 2030 market cap](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2019/02/25/ai-will-add-15-trillion-to-the-world-economy-by-2030/?sh=76b9bd4e1852), or a more recent prediction of [80 trillion by 2030 according to ark invest (likely as the most important sector)!](https://youtu.be/UBmcCRno35A)

 * Related to the core components; with ASTI's emphasis and main focus on Neural Networks, ([universal problem solvers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem))... it is ASTI lecturer's duty to always provide direct feedback and guidance throughout the lecturer's own academic software work/teachings, as well the models of the large corporations like tensorflow. 

* Separate/outside of the Syllabus-Exam rubric & Diploma, UAD lecturer Bennett introduces Human Level Ai/Artificial General Intelligence.
* Related to the aforesaid bonus component, **unlike typical Ai/Ml programs**, it is thus ASTI lecturer's duty to [softly introduce candidates into the world of Artificial General Intelligence](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/ASTIS/blob/main/data/Introduction%20to%20Artificial%20General%20Intelligence.pdf) (AGI...which is currently separate from the world of tensorflow/specialized Ai etc, and often referred to as man's last invention by Dr Ben Goertzel, and several other AGI pioneers).
